Session authentication is a common method used to authenticate users in web applications. It involves the use of session tokens or session IDs to track and verify user sessions.

Here's a basic overview of how session authentication works:

User logs in: When a user logs in to a web application, their credentials (such as username and password) are verified by the server.

Session creation: Upon successful authentication, the server creates a unique session ID or token for the user. This session ID is typically stored in a server-side session store.

Session ID sent to client: The server sends the session ID back to the client (usually as a cookie) to be stored locally.

Subsequent requests: For each subsequent request, the client sends the session ID back to the server. The server uses this session ID to retrieve the corresponding session data from the session store.

Session validation: The server validates the session ID and ensures that it is still active and associated with a valid user. If the session is valid, the request is processed; otherwise, the user may be prompted to log in again.

Session termination: When the user logs out or the session expires, the session ID is invalidated and removed from the session store.

It's important to note that session authentication requires proper session management to ensure security and prevent session hijacking or session fixation attacks.
